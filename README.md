# MarioPlan
MarioPlan is a simple project for learn react, redux & firebase. 
This project was inspired by NetNinja ([Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3)) and the [repository](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/React-Redux-Firebase-App) . 
Please watch his cool vidio :)

...this project is not exactly 100% same as NetNinja. The key difference list :
 - this project don't use some dependency ([react-redux-firebase](https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase) and [redux-firestore](https://github.com/prescottprue/redux-firestore))
 - this project used [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) 
 - To login, email must be verified. Link for verification will be send after sign up.
